/**
 *
 * Class: java.DataModel.TransportationData.RouteData.Itinerary
 *
 * <p>This class stores the information of one itinerary with all of its
 * journeys.
 * <p></p>
 * it stores the total duration of the itinerary (to get from the origin to the
 * destination) and its maximum walking distance as we will need them to
 * decide on the best itinerary in a specific {@link Route}.
 * <p></p>
 * However, it also have an array of Journeys of type {@link RouteJourney}
 * and it stores the information about a full journey, including the metro
 * lines and buses you have to take â€¦etc.
 * <p></p>
 * The information of this class is filled by {@link JsonRouteReader}, with the
 * response of the TMB API after requesting a Route with valid parameters.
 * <p></p>
 * Furthermore, this class offers only the default constructor with no
 * parameters, this constructor initializes all the attributes.
 * Also, it offers a method called <b>add</b> that adds objects from type
 * {@link RouteJourney} to the journeys array. Moreover, this class has
 * getters and setters to insert information into the attributes and to get
 * it when needed.
